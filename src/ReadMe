ABOUT THE PROJECT
------------------
   This is a personal web site for myself to use in future. So I use django's default
 admin interface to manage the data and all visitors can do is to view the site and 
 leave comments.
   To log in the admin site the current Username/Password is : "chen" "123456"

   There are 5 parts of content in my site, they are
   """
   Project
     |___Home				#Home page, using a html to display my CV
     |___Blog				#My blog, managed by using django admin	interface
     |___Readings			#My reading list
     |___Photography		#My photography. Due to time limit, it is linked to another site
     |___Price Compare		#A cross site price parity site for price comparation.
   """
