  - Good set of functionality.

Polish: 8/10 [The functionality that was implemented.  Both features and quality were evaluated.]
  - would have liked to see fewer features, but more general (not specific to you, editing interface, etc).

Technical style: 8/10 [Overall review of how things were implemented: coding style etc.]
  - well structured code.
  - style shows a little non-Pythonic Java/C++ influence
  - invalid markup produced
