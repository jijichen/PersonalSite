          Whoopaa is a startup that began as a social network where users were able to separate their business- and personal social life. As this idea didn't exactly take off the way we expected it to, we changed the idea. We began a job matching platform, where Whoopaa became the place for job seekers to make an interactive CV enriched with certified tests. The place where companies can create job openings and efficiently find the right candidates needed a name as well, and was called HRMatches. I developed an own framework, which I improved in user experience and speed after the big idea change. I also developed the real time match algorithm as well as a lot of other helpful algorithms. Whoopaa is my current full-time job.        </span>

          My second internship and the place I eventually graduated, was at Davinci. I investigated new web-technologies they could possibly use to improve the front-end of their java-based CRM system. I compared technologies such as Adobe Flex, Silverlight, Ruby on Rails together, to find out which could work best for the company. Based on the results of my research, the company eventually decided to use the ZK Framework.        </span>
